Resources and notes for the algorithms study group with Learn Teach Code (Created by @ThuyNT13, @mtroiani, @LearningNerd, @loorin, and @nurarenke)

## Next ideas

  - Include resources in this repo like primers on algorithm topics, and maybe lists of suggested links and other stuff? See below.
  
  - Maybe try publishing meeting notes to keep an archive of what happens at each meetup, similar to https://github.com/fullstackla/pairing-meetup/issues/159
  
  - collect challenges that are good practice materials for meetups


## Being developed

   - Creating a wiki of resources: https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/algorithms-group/wiki
   - **Gist Study Guides** shared at presentations/workshops given at meetups, and that people can download
     - [Big O Notation](https://gist.github.com/ThuyNT13/16bc1cf4242e5e2ba84d20c47be793b0)
     - [LinkedList](https://gist.github.com/ThuyNT13/85815881d64061ef3e21671a233f8e43)
     - [HashMaps](https://gist.github.com/mtroiani/e03e48aa23b7e46b151d52ac042a8fa3)
     - [Recursion and DP](https://gist.github.com/mtroiani/b30108f4cae4ccd1d511ee6dd53f2949)
     - [Arrays](https://gist.github.com/mtroiani/899541a99c9e900dd017b0f1b48c7314)
     - [Trees](https://gist.github.com/mtroiani/b5d24d89dbbf1cf5cd922693c3c4a1cf)
