# algorithms-group
Resources and notes for the algorithms study group with Learn Teach Code (Created by @ThuyNT13, @mtroiani, @LearningNerd and @nurarenke)

## Next ideas

  - Include resources in this repo like primers on algorithm topics, and maybe lists of suggested links and other stuff? See below.
  
  - Maybe try publishing meeting notes to keep an archive of what happens at each meetup, similar to https://github.com/fullstackla/pairing-meetup/issues/159
  
  - collect challenges that are good practice materials for meetups


## Being developed

   - Creating a wiki of resources: https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/algorithms-group/wiki
